# This is a simple app for energy consumption overview 

### Before starting:
Keep in my mind that this is the main repository, that depends on another two repositories (submodules). 

I divided them into two parts, frontend and backend, and wrapped them in this principal container to keep things organized.

To clone the project correctly, run:

    - git clone --recursive git@github.com:C0rv0dev/energy-node.git

That way, you can set your env variables and run:

    - docker-compose up -d

and voil√†, everything is set up! :smile:
